# AI-HealthCare-Chatbot

This "AI Healthcare Chatbot Website for Medical Queries" project aims to improve healthcare accessibility by providing users with an intelligent, AI-driven chatbot for real-time medical consultations. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to address users' health-related queries, offer symptom assessments, and provide medical guidance. Additionally, the system enables users to upload documents such as PDFs and DOCX files for more personalized consultations. By integrating pre-trained ChatGPT models with Pinecone for efficient data retrieval, the chatbot ensures rapid, accurate, and contextually relevant responses, making it a valuable tool for both patients and healthcare providers. The system also incorporates location-based services using the Geoapify API, allowing users to find nearby hospitals based on location. The website's front end is built using customizable HTML templates and Flask, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface accessible across various devices. This project is designed to offer scalable, 24/7 healthcare support, reducing the burden on medical staff and helping users in underserved areas access timely and reliable health information. The AI chatbot system optimizes healthcare delivery and enhances patient outcomes by automating routine consultations and providing location-based assistance.
